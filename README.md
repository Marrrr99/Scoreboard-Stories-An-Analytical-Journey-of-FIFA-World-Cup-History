# Scoreboard Stories: An Analytical Journey of FIFA World Cup History

The *"Scoreboard Stories"* project aims to explore the fascinating tales of the FIFA World Cup through the lens of data and analysis using *Power BI* with data sourced from *Kaggle* and processed through *Excel*.

By collecting and analyzing World Cup data from its inception, we delve into the details of matches, goals, teams, and players to uncover patterns and trends that tell the historical story of this grand event. This project explores whether there are recurring strategies and analyzes how different factors, such as locations and weather conditions, impact match outcomes.

## Project Objectives

- *Historical Insights*: Investigate and analyze historical data from past World Cups using Excel data sources from Kaggle and Power BI.
- *Patterns & Trends*: Identify patterns in match outcomes, goal distributions, and team performances over the years.
- *Impact of External Factors*: Examine how factors like location, weather, and time of year influence results.
- *Data-Driven Stories*: Present compelling stories of key moments in World Cup history through interactive Power BI visualizations and analysis.

## Data Source

- The data used in this project was obtained from *Kaggle, a popular platform for datasets. The dataset contains detailed historical records of FIFA World Cup matches, players, teams, and events. It was then processed and cleaned in **Excel* before being imported into *Power BI* for analysis.
  
  You can find the dataset on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/), or you can download it directly from the project repository.

## Features

1. *Excel Data Sources*: The historical World Cup data is sourced from Kaggle and stored in Excel files, which are imported into Power BI for analysis.
2. *Interactive Power BI Dashboards*: Power BI dashboards allow users to explore the data interactively, revealing trends and insights.
3. *Visualizations*: Power BI visualizations, including charts, maps, and tables, help to present findings in an intuitive and clear way.
4. *Storytelling*: Unveil the stories behind the scoreboards, highlighting significant events and trends throughout World Cup history.
## How to Use This Project

1. *Download Power BI*: Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
2. *Access Excel Files*: Download the Excel data files from the project repository.
3. *Load Excel Data into Power BI: Open the provided Power BI (.pbix) file and ensure that the Excel files are correctly linked to the Power BI model. If necessary, you can manually load the Excel files by using the **Get Data** option in Power BI.
